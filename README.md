## Description

An application that allows you to take content generated in [chappie_server](https://github.com/Think-Root/chappie_server) and publish it in the social networks like telegram/twitter/whatsapp.

I once had the idea to create an app that would manage a Telegram channel by searching for and posting interesting repositories using AI. That idea eventually grew into this project. You can read more details about how the idea was born here: [Part 1](https://drukarnia.com.ua/articles/yak-chatgpt-vede-za-mene-kanal-v-telegram-i-u-nogo-ce-maizhe-vikhodit-chastina-1-VywRW) and [Part 2](https://drukarnia.com.ua/articles/yak-chatgpt-vede-za-mene-kanal-v-telegram-i-u-nogo-ce-maizhe-vikhodit-chastina-2-X9Yjz). (The articles are in Ukrainian, but I think youâ€™ll manage to translate them into your preferred language.)

## Social networks integrations

Currently, the bot supports 3 integrations, two official (telegram, twitter) and one unofficial (whatsapp)

### Telegram

Publishes posts to a Telegram channel, allows managing some functions through a Telegram bot

### bot commands

- **/add** - you can provide a list (or just one) of GitHub repository URLs separated by spaces, a short description will be generated for each, and they will be added to the database.
- **/next** - displays the next post scheduled for publication in the channel, if you provide a number after a space, that many posts will be shown
- **/gen** - generates a post for the channel from GitHub trends, if you specify a number after a space, that many posts will be generated and added to the database
- **/info** - shows information about the posts in the database

### Twitter

This integration allows you to publish posts on your Twitter account. For operation, it requires deploying the [think-root/x](https://github.com/Think-Root/x) app, which implements the official Twitter API in the form of a small server.


### Whatsapp

This integration allows you to publish posts to a WhatsApp channel. The integration is not official, and its use may **lead to your WhatsApp account being banned**. To use this integration, you will need to deploy the [think-root/wapp](https://github.com/Think-Root/wapp) app
